Jackson Christian began in 1976 with 56 students in grades 1-8. In 1979, the school moved from its first location at the Central church of Christ to its present location, a beautiful and spacious 41.3-acre campus on Country Club Lane. The student population of more than 850 reflects a geographical, denominational, racial and ethnic diversity of West TN. We are deeply motivated in all facets by our faith in Jesus Christ. We are firmly committed to reflect God's unconditional love for all people. Biblical principles serve as our ultimate guide as well as goal. It is important to us that every word, action, and attitude of Jackson Christian employees, representatives, volunteers, and students be consistent with and in furtherance of our Christ-centered purposes: both publicly and privately. 
<br><br>
All activities, which Jackson Christian pursues, are for the dual religious purposes of glorifying Christ and furthering our Christian mission, message, and viewpoint. 
<br><br>
Our commitment to our faith is outlined in, but not limited to: the Parent/Student Handbook, the Teacher Handbook, the Board Policy Manual, the Mission Statement, and the Purpose Statement. 
<br><br>
Accreditation: Jackson Christian is accredited by Cognia and the National Christian School Association. We are also the first private school in the state of Tennessee to be STEM certified by AdvancED. In 2018, Jackson Christian Elementary was awarded the Tennessee STEM School Designation. 
<br><br>
Students: Our enrollment of more than 850 students includes our program for 2-4 year-olds at 1490 Campbell Street and our 2 month-old through 12th grade programs on the main campus. 
<br><br>
Faculty: On the main campus, over 65 percent of faculty hold a masterâ€™s or doctoral degree. Our student to faculty ratio is 13:1, providing great opportunities for our students. 
<br><br>
Location: Our main campus for preschool through grade twelve is located at 832 Country Club, Jackson, Tennessee, just off of The Columns shopping district. 
<br><br>
Athletics: Competitive programs include basketball, baseball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, bass fishing, and track and field. State championships include baseball in 2008 and 2014 and football in 2006. Our boys' basketball advanced to the final four in 2010. In 2014, girls' basketball was regional champion. In soccer, our girls' team advanced to the state tournament in 2013, 2014 and 2015; boys' soccer was state runner-up in 2010.
