# JCS-SGA

This site was made for Chris Morris, head of the Jackson Christian SGA. There are six pages in total.

The first page is a home page. It contains a carousel with images of the SGA doing things, like reading to the elementary children, and homecoming in the gym. These are all SGA-planned events.
